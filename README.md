# The-Titanic-clasification-Model
# Problem statement : "The Titanic ship  sea accident caused  the world  much and is  one of the  worst marine accidents that was witnessed, its occurrence left  non healing wounds for those who lost their loved ones and to the human race at large it is something that is hard to forget. Many  researches and studies to  date have been done  to  determine the survivors  and those who  met their demise. To uncover  this mystery, we are  tasked to build a model to classify whether one survived the accident  or not. This model will help much in  solving future occurrences of such cases."
# Main objective  :  "To Train a classification machine learning model that classifies whether a breast mass is Malignant or Benign upon feeding certain data observation to the model."
# Data Understanding Overview
For this research project, we are using the  3 datasets provided by the company, which are on this drive : “https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xjnMNkKIqYBy-uo8OWBbFvummseFxUYo”
# Data preparation steps:
* data cleaning which involves checking and dealing with outliers and duplicates,Outlier detection and  treatment of the outliers.
* Data engineering for modelling  which includes encoding categorical variables, spliting data to test and train sets.

  # Data modelling : trained various classification anf evaluated  performance for each to com up with the best model to use
